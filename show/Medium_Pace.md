# Medium Pace

## Stage Lights (LumiPar 12UAW5 #1–3)
Minimal presence lets other zones drive the momentum.
They brighten slightly when the PixieWash turns toward the audience.

## Karaoke Corner (LumiPar 7UTRI #1–2)
Colors build rhythmically to boost confidence and hint at a rising tempo.

## Music Lights

### LumiPar 12UQPro
Colors respond dynamically to vocals and instrumentation.

### PixieWash
Starting on the performer, the head swings toward the audience after roughly
150 seconds. The moment it moves, boost the Stage Lights a touch to heighten the
shift.

## Smoke & Bubbles (Smoke Machine)
Occasional mist supports the visual rhythm without drawing attention away from the performance.
