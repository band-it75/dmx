# Configuring Applause

1. Create a cue that fires automatically when VU levels drop at the end of a song.
2. Blackout the Stage Lights, then let them strobe brightly in sync with the applause.
3. Program a subtle shimmer on the Karaoke Corner fixtures using a fast sine wave effect.
4. Set Music Lights to strobe at peak VU levels; PixieWash should spin wildly toward the audience for a few seconds.
5. Trigger a single short burst of smoke as the lights reach their maximum.
6. After roughly 10 seconds, fade into the **Intermission** cue.
7. Save these settings as **Applause**.
