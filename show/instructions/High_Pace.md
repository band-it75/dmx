# Configuring High Pace

1. Duplicate the **Medium Pace** cue to build a new cue.
2. Turn Stage Lights intensity down to near zero so they remain in the background,
   but spike them slightly when the PixieWash swings toward the audience.
3. Change the Karaoke Corner color chase to rapid flashes (under 1 second per step) in vivid greens and blues.
4. Set the Music Lights to strobe when VU levels exceed a threshold and use movement macros to keep motion fast and energetic.
5. Adjust the PixieWash to start on the artist and sweep toward the audience
   after roughly 150 seconds. Couple this sweep with the brief Stage Light spike
   for dramatic emphasis.
6. Program the smoke machine for strong bursts every 45 seconds.
7. Save this as **High Pace** in the cue list.
