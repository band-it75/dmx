# Configuring Slow Pace

This cue gently engages the audience while still keeping a calm atmosphere.

1. Start from the **Intermission** cue and duplicate it as **Slow Pace**.
2. Keep the **Stage** group intensity around 50 %. Insert a brief raise to
   60 % at the 150 s mark when the **PixieWash** pans to the crowd.
3. Program the **Karaoke Corner** fixtures with a slow color chase using 10–15 s
   fade times cycling through reds and ambers.
4. Set the **Audio Analyzer** to drive the **Music Lights** with smooth fades so
   they brighten as the VU increases.
5. Create a movement track for the **PixieWash** beginning on the performer and
   slowly panning toward the audience after 150 s. Link the Stage Light bump to
   this motion.
6. Program the **Smoke Machine** to trigger short bursts every 15 s at low
   intensity.
7. Store the cue, then test by gradually raising and lowering music volume to
   see how the lights react.
