# Configuring Medium Pace

The medium pace cue increases activity while still leaving room to build toward
the finale.

1. Duplicate the **Slow Pace** cue and rename it **Medium Pace**.
2. Lower the Stage Lights intensity to about 30 %, adding a small 10 %
   brightness bump when the **PixieWash** turns toward the audience.
3. Edit the **Karaoke Corner** chase to step every five seconds, giving the
   impression of rising tempo.
4. Configure the **Audio Analyzer** so that higher VU levels make the
   **LumiPar 12UQPro** fixtures brighter and alternate between red and yellow on
   the color wheel.
5. Set a movement track for the **PixieWash** that begins on the performer and
   pans to the audience after roughly 150 s, synchronized with the Stage Light
   bump.
6. Schedule the **Smoke Machine** for short bursts every 25 s.
7. After verifying timing and brightness, store the cue in the list.
