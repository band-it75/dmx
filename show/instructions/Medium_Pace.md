# Configuring Medium Pace

1. Duplicate the **Slow Pace** cue to create a new cue.
2. Reduce Stage Lights intensity to 30% so other zones stand out. Momentarily
   raise them about 10% when the PixieWash flips to the audience.
3. Increase the color-change speed of the Karaoke Corner chase to around 5 seconds per step.
4. In the VU plugin, map higher levels to brighter outputs on the Music Lights and use the color wheel to alternate between reds and yellows.
5. Program the PixieWash to start on the performer and swing toward the audience
   after roughly 150 seconds, linking the brief Stage Light bump to that swing.
6. Trigger the smoke machine for short bursts every 25 seconds.
7. Save these settings as **Medium Pace**.
