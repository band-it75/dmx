# Configuring High Pace

This cue brings maximum energy with aggressive color changes and heavy strobing.

1. Duplicate the **Medium Pace** cue and rename the copy **High Pace**.
2. In the **Stage** group, lower dimmer values close to zero so other fixtures
   dominate. Add a short **flash** step that bumps intensity when the
   **PixieWash** sweeps toward the audience.
3. For **Karaoke Corner**, increase the chase rate to less than one second per
   step and alternate vivid greens and blues.
4. Edit the **Audio Analyzer** triggers so that high VU levels cause the
   **LumiPar 12UQPro** fixtures to strobe rapidly. Apply movement macros to keep
   them spinning between beats.
5. Program the **PixieWash** to begin on the artist, then perform a fast sweep
   toward the crowd after about 150 s, syncing the Stage Light flash with this
   move.
6. Schedule the **Smoke Machine** for strong bursts every 45 s to emphasize
   musical climaxes.
7. Preview the cue and fine‑tune any timing offsets before saving it in the cue
   list.
