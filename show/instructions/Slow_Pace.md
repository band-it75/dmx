# Configuring Slow Pace

1. Start from the **Intermission** cue as a base.
2. For Stage Lights, keep intensity stable around 50% with no color changes; at
   the 150‑second mark when the PixieWash sweeps to the crowd, raise them to
   about 60% briefly.
3. Program Karaoke Corner fixtures with a slow color chase (10–15s fade time) cycling through reds and ambers.
4. Set Music Lights to respond to microphone input via the VU plugin; enable smooth fades linked to audio levels.
5. Add a movement track for the PixieWash that begins on the artist and pans
   toward the audience after 150 seconds, linking the brightness bump from the
   Stage Lights to that motion.
6. Program the smoke machine to trigger short bursts every 15 seconds at low intensity.
7. Save this setup as **Slow Pace** in your cue list.
