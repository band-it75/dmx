# Slow Pace

## Stage Lights (LumiPar 12UAW5 #1–3)
Stable and subtle illumination maintains audience focus on the performer.
When the PixieWash pans to the audience, these lights brighten slightly to
accentuate the shift.

## Karaoke Corner (LumiPar 7UTRI #1–2)
Slow color shifts match the emotional or lyrical depth of each song.

## Music Lights

### LumiPar 12UQPro
Lights fade in response to microphone VU levels.

### PixieWash
The fixture begins on the artist and, after about 150 seconds, smoothly pans
toward the audience. The brief brightness boost from the Stage Lights marks this
transition.

## Smoke & Bubbles (Smoke Machine)
Soft, frequent mist adds intimacy without overpowering the stage.
