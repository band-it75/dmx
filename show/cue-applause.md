# Applause

## Stage Lights (LumiPar 12UAW5 #1–3)
As the VU meter drops at the end of a song, let the Stage Lights flare in a
quick strobe before fading toward blackout. This burst syncs with the PixieWash
craziness.

## Karaoke Corner (LumiPar 7UTRI #1–2)
Subtle shimmer or pulses echo the audience celebration.

## Music Lights

### LumiPar 12UQPro
Lights strobe and surge wildly as soon as the applause trigger fires.

### PixieWash
The moving head spins and flashes toward the audience, going wild for a few
seconds before the scene settles into Intermission.

## Smoke & Bubbles (Smoke Machine)
A short accent puff mirrors the final light peak and marks the emotional
release. If the average VU stays below the end threshold for 10
seconds, fade back to **Intermission**.
