# Show Files

This folder contains documentation for running the lighting show.

* `DMX_Map.md` lists the DMX addressing for all fixtures.
* `SHOW.md` gives a quick overview of lighting behavior in each scenario.
* `VU_Triggers.md` explains how the show starts and ends automatically based on VU levels.
* Individual scenario files (`Intermission.md`, `Slow_Pace.md`, etc.) describe every scene in detail.
* Configuration guides for DMXControl 3.3.0 are located in the `instructions/` subfolder. See `instructions/README.md` for detailed setup of the Audio Analyzer plugin.
