# High Pace

## Stage Lights (LumiPar 12UAW5 #1–3)
Silent support keeps the focus on other lighting zones.
When PixieWash sweeps toward the audience, raise these lights briefly for extra
punch.

## Karaoke Corner (LumiPar 7UTRI #1–2)
High-energy flashes react urgently to the beat.

## Music Lights

### LumiPar 12UQPro
Lights burst, strobe, and change direction in sync with the music.

### PixieWash
The moving head begins locked on the artist. After about 150 seconds it sweeps
over the crowd. That movement cues a short brightness bump from the Stage Lights
before the full‑throttle strobe continues.

## Smoke & Bubbles (Smoke Machine)
Bold bursts emphasize strobe peaks and chorus hits for dramatic impact.
